### 4. Updated Calendar View: Year 1 Cash Flow (with Debt Service)

| Month | Gross Rent | Expenses | Debt Service | NOI | Pre-Tax Cash Flow | After-Tax Cash Flow | Running After-Tax CF |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|-----|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Jan   | $9,200     | $4,490   | $6,995       | $4,710 | -$2,285         | -$2,285            | -$2,285             |
| Feb   | $9,200     | $4,490   | $6,995       | $4,710 | -$2,285         | -$2,285            | -$4,570             |

| ...   | ...        | ...      | ...          | ...   | ...             | ...                | ...                 |
| Dec   | $9,200     | $4,490   | $6,995       | $4,710 | -$2,285         | -$2,285            | -$27,420            |

**Notes:**
- Expenses include operating, management, maintenance, and insurance.
- Debt service is the total mortgage payment (principal + interest).
- NOI is before debt service; pre-tax cash flow is after debt service.
- After-tax cash flow is the same as pre-tax in Year 1 due to negative taxable income.
- Negative cash flow is common in leveraged real estate in early years; equity builds via principal paydown and appreciation.

### 5. Updated Partner-Level Table

| Partner         | Initial Investment | Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow | Annual After-Tax Cash Flow |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Brett Bergin    | $105,065          | -$9,140                 | -$9,140                   |
| Jeffrey Whitson | $105,065          | -$9,140                 | -$9,140                   |
| Jacob Whitson   | $105,065          | -$9,140                 | -$9,140                   |

### 6. Implications of Financing
- **Lower initial investment** per partner, enabling leverage and potential for higher returns on equity.
- **Negative cash flow** in early years is offset by principal paydown, appreciation, and tax benefits (depreciation and interest deductions).
- **Interest is tax-deductible**, reducing taxable income.
- **Equity builds** as the mortgage is paid down and property values increase.
- **Risk:** Must plan for negative cash flow and have reserves to cover shortfalls.
